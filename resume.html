      <br>
      I have worked on indie projects for 2D, 3D and mobile games. I have been coding for the past 3 years and scripting is one of my favorite parts of developing games.

      <h3>ZiggyZag (2021)</h3>
      <p>
        Mobile game in which player is required to tap the screen to change direction of the ball which has a set velocity.
        <br>
        In this game, I utilized concepts like Class Inheritance and I used a tag script to manage all my string references.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h3>FreezyFall (2021)</h3>
      <p>
        Top/Down platformer mobile game where the player needs to avoid colliding with deadly spikes at the top of the screen and monsters on some platforms.
        <br>
        A working shop system was implemented and Unity Ads were coded.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h3>Save The Bunny (2020)</h3>
      <p>
        The player is a bunny rabbit who needs to avoid falling obstacles. The enemies are instantiated off-screen at the top position and gravity is applied.
        <br>
        The particle system is set to enable upon impact
      </p>
      <br>
      <h3>Nick’s Run (2020)</h3>
      <p>
        The player is Santa Claus and needs to jump over oncoming obstacles. Obstacles are instantiated off-screen at the right position.
        <br>
        These obstacles spawn at random and are all in a Gameobject Array.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h3>Space Shooter (2019)</h3>
      <p>
        The player is a spaceship and needs to destroy an endless wave of enemies who spawn at random.
        <br>
        The player can collect any of four powerups which also spawn at random. The “Life” powerup will not spawn if the player is at full Health.
        <br>
        A two-player mode has been set to trigger via a Boolean. Control mapping is different and additional methods are used in code.e.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h3>Data Interchange: March 2019 – September 2019 (England)</h3>
      <p>
        [6 Months Contract] At DI, we did Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) which is essential the exchange of electronic document from B2B (Business to Business).
        <br>
        My role was assigned as Technical Engineer (Drag & Drop Programmer) where I translated documents from one EDIFact Standard to the next using an application called Xlate Evolution.
        <br>
        This allowed us to map standards such as ANSII, Sap IDOCs, Delfors, Desadvs, Deljits, etc. Along with using the application, we also heavily used C# coding to assist us with the mapping process as a lot of the maps’ logic differed.
