      ● I am a gameplay programmer with strong C# skills. I develop games using the Unity Game Engine for which I am certified. I have worked on multiple personal projects and currently have 2 mobile games shipped to the Google Play Store.
      <br>
      ● I have worked on indie projects for 2D, 3D and mobile games. I've utilized features such as Unity's timeline, Cinemachines, Unity's old and new Input Systems, the Device Simulator, Post-processing, Physics, and a lot more.
      <br>
      ● I have been coding for the past 3 years and scripting is one of my favourite parts of developing games. I understand script communication and always try to code as defensively as I can. I understand and have implemented inheritance, classes, namespaces, Enums, Coroutines, Dictionaries, Loops, Arrays, OOP, and many more concepts.</p>
